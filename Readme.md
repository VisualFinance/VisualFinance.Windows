**VisualFinance.Windows** is an open source repository for windows controls aimed at Financial applications.

What you get:  
-------------
Free to use windows controls for WPF, Silverlight and Windows Metro. You can have the source code or the compiled libraries. As much as possible these libraries have a minimal dependency on 3rd party libraries and just require the .NET framework.

Why you get it:  
---------------
VisualFinance.org is based on two principles:  
	1.	IT Departments in Captial Markets industry should focus effort on technology that serves the competitive advantage of company.  
	2.	DataGrids should not be the default way to present data. Understanding the problem deeply, often leads to a visual solution that is not a data grid, or as Tufte calls them "Data Prisons".

If your project really does need a blotter, then feel free to use or modify our controls. We also want to provide what we think are better or just different ways of presenting data. 

We dont just want to give you the control, we also want to be able to show you how and why we built it. This way, if there is something you want to change something, you either will 
* stop and realise that maybe it is a poor idea, and there is a better way
* understand the problem deeply and can make an appropriate change

These changes can then either be implemented locally or pushed back to the community.

How you get it:  
---------------
We believe that you should be able to get a library to solve your problem or just pick out the file that you need. Composition of atomic parts, not big fat monolith libraries. You can either pull down the latest nightly build, or just pick out the files or assemblies you need.
